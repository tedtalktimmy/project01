# Project 1 

# Description
When you are working on trying to solve a problem as a web developer or building an application it can get overwhelming.
This is the time when a mental break is needed most to let 
Your mind settles. We have designed a webpage where you 
can come breathe and recollect your thought process.
LoafLounge is a placed designed for web developers too 
come and ease their minds, comment on their day, and also
a place for resources to hopefully solve their problem.
So come on and loaf around.
